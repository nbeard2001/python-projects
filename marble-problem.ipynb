    "### I have a bag of marbles. If I pull the marbles out by 2, there is one left over. If I pull them out by 3, there are 2 left over. By 4, 3; by 5, 4; by 6,5; and by 7, 0. What is the minimum number of marbles in the bag?\n",

    "This first section will ask for two inputs, a list of divisors and a list of remainders. These lists need to be the same length. In the terms of the marble problem, we think of the divisors as the number of marbles we pull out at a time and the remainders as how many marbles we want left once we have pulled out as many groups of our divisor as possible. \n",

We populate a list of these and find the first number satsifying the condition. Simply put, the number-remainder(i) is divisible by divisor(i).
